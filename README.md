## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Inexhaustible thirst for brain-teasers, be it quizzes, riddles, code or puzzles.

### *Currently studying programming at Hive Helsinki*

**I'm especially drawn to technologies that justify themselves by:**
  - Improving wellbeing â€” in healthcare, education, accessibility, or the arts
  - Helping organizations run more efficiently and sustainably
  - Promoting long-term responsible design

Constantly trying to learn new skills and expand my horizons towards green coding practices.
**ðŸ“¬Don't be a stranger -> LinkedIn**
